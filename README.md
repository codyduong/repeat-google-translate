# repeat-google-translate
**THIS WEBSITE CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK.**

A website that was built to translate phrases multiple times across multiple languages.

However, as the google cloud API costs money, and I haven't found a convenient workaround (that works with my other dependencies),
this project will probably never actually work. Oh well. If anyone ever finds a npm package that isn't riddled with security
vulernabilites, and works, please halp.

## Dev
